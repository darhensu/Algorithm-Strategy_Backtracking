# Algorithm Strategy - Implementation of The Backtracking Algorithm in The Sudoku Game using The Python Programming Language
In this modern era, technology is needed to simplify and solve problems to increase efficiency. One area of science that is often used to solve problems by imitating human behavior is artificial intelligence.

The development of information technology occurs in various fields, one of which is in the field of games. One of them is Sudoku. Sudoku is a logic-based number puzzle game. In general, a Sudoku puzzle consists of 81 squares arranged into 9 rows, 9 columns, and 9 subsections. The main objective of the game is to fill in all the squares with the numbers 1 to 9.

The backtracking algorithm is an improvement over the brute force algorithm which builds a state-space tree to find a solution. Formation of the state space tree in the backtracking algorithm is based on the principle of depth-first search (DFS). The principle of the backtracking algorithm is that if an error occurs in completing a node, it will backtrack to the previous node. Therefore, this algorithm is very efficient and ideal for solving problems related to AI games, especially number games like Sudoku.
